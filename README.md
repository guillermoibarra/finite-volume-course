# Fundamentals of Finite Volume Methods in CFD: Theory, Practice, and Implementation in Python

This repository contains the course materials for the "Fundamentals of Finite Volume Methods in CFD: Theory, Practice, and Implementation with Python" course. The course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and its application in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using Python.

## Course Overview

This course is aimed at graduate students, researchers, and professionals who want to build a solid foundation in CFD and FVM. Participants will gain theoretical knowledge, develop practical skills, and apply this knowledge to solve basic CFD problems using Python.

## Course Modules

- **Basic Linux**: Learn essential Linux commands and package management.
- **Developer Tools**: Set up development environments, version control, and debugging techniques.
- **Basic Python**: Fundamental programming concepts in Python.
- **Linear Algebra in Python**: Implement linear algebra concepts in Python.
- **Finite Volume Method in CFD**: Understand and apply FVM in CFD using Python.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of linear algebra
- Familiarity with transport phenomena and fluid dynamics

## Tools and Resources

Participants should bring a laptop with VirtualBox installed. A preconfigured Xubuntu operating system image with all necessary software will be provided.

Course materials, including notes, presentations, and practical activities, are created using JupyterLab and will be available in this repository.

## Instructor

The course is taught by Guillermo Ibarra, a member of the Open Multi-Physics group at the National Institute for Nuclear Research (ININ). The course also aims to promote the use of open-source tools like OpenFOAM.
